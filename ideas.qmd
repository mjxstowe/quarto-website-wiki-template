### 24 FEB 2023 // :sparkle: quarto templates

To use quarto templates: `quarto use template github/repo`

### 13 FEB 2023 // Quarto research compendium?

Had an idea about using quarto website as a research compendium for tracking:

-   thesis plan
-   supervisor meeting notes
-   random thoughts and ideas
-   literature summaries
-   glossary, references

It would be extra cool if you could serve the static site semi-privately so only specific people can see it. [^1]
